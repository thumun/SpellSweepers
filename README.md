# Spell Sweepers 

Spell Sweepers is designed for one player ages eight and up, with each level taking approximately five minutes to play. The player is a novice spellcaster trying to clean up a room for their client, the first of which is their grandmother. Clean up the room to the best of your ability before grandma returns (or else itâ€™s game over)! The better a job that you do, the more stars you will be rewarded.

## How to Play! 

The player has 3 spells that they can use in the game at the cost of mana. There is not a cooldown period between spells, but mana is scarce, so they have to be careful with their casting. Mana can be acquired by completing cleaning tasks such as collecting dust bunnies. 

Player Controls 
- Control Spell: Hold down the Trigger button and draw a circle (a horizontal circle works more often). Then select the object you wish to use this spell on with A, B, X, or Y. You can throw objects with this spell by selecting an object, moving it in the direction you want it to be thrown in, and then letting it go. 
- Slow Down Spell: Hold down the Trigger button and draw a line from up to down. Then select the object you wish to use this spell on with A, B, X, or Y.  This spell can only be cast on the cat or the cauldron. 
- Vacuum Spell: Hold down the Trigger button and draw a line from right to left. You can drop items in your vacuum by pressing A, B, X, or Y. You can use this spell to collect dust bunnies (part of one of the main tasks), and if the vacuum intersects with objects, they will be dragged in as well. These unwanted objects can be dropped (or this spell can be used to carefully move objects to place in the cauldron if the player so chooses). 
- Stop Spell: Aim away from any selectable objects and press A, B, X, or Y. A spell will only deactivate after a spell has been cast. If an item is selected or in the vacuum cone, then the items will be dropped. 
- Select Item: Aim at the object you wish to select and press A, B, X, or Y. An item will only be selected when a spell is cast. 
- Drop items (when vacuum or control spell active): Press A, B, X, or Y.
